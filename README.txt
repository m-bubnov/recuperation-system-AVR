The developed recuperative system consists of 2 devices: the control unit (transmitt_part) and the heat recuperator (receive_part). The control unit is responsible for setting and adjusting the recuperator modes. Also, it has a built-in temperature sensor and real-time sensor.

*Operating principle of modes 

This system has 4 operating modes: "day" mode, "ventilation" mode, "night" mode, forced shutdown. During operation of the recuperator in "day" mode, the device begins to circulate air within 20 minutes at average power of fans, providing easy freshness in the room and good noise reduction. At the end of this period, the fan goes off for 40 minutes. The "ventilation" mode is designed only for rapid air flow in the room where the fans are running at the peak of their power.
